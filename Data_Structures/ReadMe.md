# Java Data Structures
## My lates work showcasing efficient algorithm development for searching, sorting, and text compression.
### Some of the examples presented from my coding developed based on fundamental data structures for information processing, including lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Includes relevant concepts such as: 

+ Recursion and recursive backtracking.
+ Sorting and algorithm analysis.
+ Binary Search trees and Huffman encoding.
+ Hash Tables, Heaps and priority queues.
